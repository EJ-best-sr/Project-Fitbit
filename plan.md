# The plan and task distributions 

## Important info 
1. We decided for now to use the `viridis` color palette for the plots from matplotlib (also available in seaborn). 
2. You can check out the `main_example.py` file under `script/part1`. Download it and run it (make sure you have all the files from the `part1` folder downloaded and saved in the same folder as well as the `daily_acivity.csv`. As you can see, everything is in *viridis* color palette so far.
